Tender for a building site
--------------------
The program stores in separate files information about the objects that need to be built, information about contractors and their employees.

It is possible to add / search / edit information, as well as announce a tender for the construction of a certain object.

Task
--------------------
There is a list of objects (an apartment house for a different number of floors, a trading house, bridges, cars and railways, etc.) that can build a list of contractors, each element of which contains a list of workers. Each element of the list of workers contains wages and the type of object on the construction of which it can be occupied. The list of objects includes the type of object, the number of workers required for the construction of an object, the minimum cost of materials for building an object. Required:
+ Carry out a tender for the construction of a given facility. The results are sorted either by price or by speed. The speed of execution is estimated as the number of workers employed in construction.
+ Provide the ability to add, delete and update list entries, as well as view entire lists.

How to use
--------------------
Open the exe file and you can already browse the lists. To add a list, click the "Add" button below. To edit the list - first turn on the editing in the menu, and then just click on the cells of the table. To declare a tender - just click the appropriate button in the menu and enter the name of the object.
